# Available Commands

The udisks2 upstream project comes with a few commands which can be used
to control and manage the udisks2 service. This page gives a short overview
of those commands which are available as part of the snap and what they are used for.
Further details about their usage is given on linked pages.

## udisksctl

The udisksctl command offers a command-line based way to control and manage the
udisks2 service. It allows the user to query for available storage devices, mount
or unmount them.

An explanation of the command and available options is available
[here](https://udisks.freedesktop.org/docs/latest/udisksctl.1.html)

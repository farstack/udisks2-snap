# Supported Filesystems

The udisks2 snap generally supports all filesystem types that the kernel supports
from the device that the snap is current installed on. The following is an
incomplete list of filesystems which are supported by the standard Ubuntu kernel
used on all Ubuntu Core reference devices but will be different for other devices.

 * FAT16 / FAT32
 * NTFS (read-only)
 * EXT 2/3/4
 * BTRFS
 * ZFS
